# Some side notes for my Vapor project
## Side Notes
- the whole frontend is pretty much the `/WebsiteController.swift` file mixed with the `/Resources` folder
- there are both the handlers that return a **View** and post handlers that return a **Response**

## Questions
- need to understand the token thingy better, why include it in the web app and not in the RapidAPI yet it still works (i think just the /api endpoint makes it work like normal)
- same question with the login
- custom validations

## ToDo
- please fix the cookies footer
- fix the register showing up when youâ€™re not in the home folder
- categories in acronym creation not working
